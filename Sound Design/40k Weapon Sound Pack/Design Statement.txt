The '40k Weapon Soundpack' is an ongoing personal project with the goal of creating a suite of weapon sound effects inspired by the Warhammer 40,000 IP.
The '40k' IP is portrayed across a wide variety of video game genres. Almost all of these games include the iconic 'Bolt Gun'(Bolter). 
Every portrayal of this weapon has dissappointed me, not mechanically, but because I do not believe the sound effects used represent how the weapon functions canonically.
The Bolt Gun fires a massive caliber, self-propelled, exploding warhead, and I felt no auditory medium has done the weapon justice. 

Currently, this pack features three gun shot effects--one for the standard bolter, one for the pistol version, and one for its heavy machine gun iteration. 
Additionally included are short clips of what multiple bursts of fire might sound like. 

Each sound effect was created through a combination of 5 heavily modified samples taken from freesounds.org
Individual samples were processed heavily, each being fine tuned, compressed, and equalized so that they could be spliced together to create the sounds I invisioned.
